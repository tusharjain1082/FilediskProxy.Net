# FilediskProxy.Net
A very-very simple tutorial level and basic example in C++ and C# and .Net of a simple ordinary file backend based full fledged Virtual Disk Drive kernel driver. We have a user interface combined Server-Client Application in C# .Net which binds with the driver to build a file backed Virtual Disk Drive. The C# .Net Application is the Core Proxy Server, and it uses the Driver to run a Virtual Disk Drive through it.

Please note that the work is in progress.
